    <p class="about">Hello.<br> What you are looking at is a project on mail art.  I invite you to
    look at the piece and visit the website ‘mcgingras.github.io/synthesia'
    where you will be prompted to enter a song; Think of any song you’d like.
    Whatever comes to mind after looking at the piece is what you should
    contribute. I am interested in seeing how different people think of
    different types of music after looking at the same visual. The images have
    been left intentionally vague and bordering arbitrariness. The idea is not
    to confirm any preconcived tie between color/form and emotion; it is to see
    if the same image can conjure a wide range of music tastes from an array of
    audiences. This project improves with the amount of people that particpate,
    so if you could, please share this postcard with a friend.<br> -m</p> </body>
